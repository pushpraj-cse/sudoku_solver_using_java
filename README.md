# Sudoku Solver
This project is a Sudoku solver implemented in Java using the NetBeans IDE.


## Description
- As the name indicates, the project is to solve a Sudoku puzzle. It also includes some special features. 
- Sudoku is a combinatorial number-placement puzzle with a 9 x 9 cell grid partially filled in with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill the remaining, blank fields with the rest of the numbers so that each row and column will have only one number of each kind.

## Introduction:-
- This project is a logic-based puzzle that uses combinatorial-number placement. In a classic Sudoku puzzle, the task is to fill the numbers in a 9 x 9 grid laced in such a way that each row, each column, and each of the sub-grid of the size 3 x 3 contains all the numbers from 1 to 9.
- In this approach, we assign numbers one-by-one to empty cells. Before assigning any number, we check whether the same is present in the current column, current row, or the current 3 x 3 sub-grid or not. If the same number is present, then we take another number and check its safety.
  

## Process:
fist of all we have some empty space in the project, by clicking the below 1 to 9 number u can fill it in and check it.

-  1 to 9 Buttons:- we can see all buttons from 1 to 9 are light blue in color in one line at the bottom. but when we select any of these numbers it will turn royal BLUE, and the rest all turn black.               in this project, at last, we saw 4 buttons are there, let's see the uses and functions of these numbers one by one,

1. Reset button:- by clicking this button we can reset our game, when we click on the reset button we got a confirmation YES_NO message to reset, as we see in the below picture.                
                                                                            
2. Exit button:- if we want to exit then we can click on the exit button and by clicking exit we get a confirmation message "If you want to exit: yes or no". if we click on yes, then it should close the game application. and if we do not want to exit, then click "no".
   
4. solution and hide solution:- when we need the solution of this sudoku game we can click on solution and we find the solution. after clicking the solution, the button name becomes a hide solution, now if we click this hide solution button, we can hide our solution.                                                                                                               
                                                                        
5. check moves:- after putting the numbers, there is an option to check moves, with the help of this button we can check our moves, which are right and wrong, if we put the wrong number then its turned red,    and for which are correct then it remains the same,
